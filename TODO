* use timeout when parse head, maybe use alarm before parse head
* use sendfile(), config TCP_CORK flag

* maybe we should give up the protocol of current version, we
 should use more generic protocol like HTTP to implement this
 program, so that the server side could be PHP or some higher
 level language, and we could take advantage of apache to implement
 concurrent, also the blog space can use php-server, instead of use
 pure-C.
